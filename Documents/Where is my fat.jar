I tried several times to build the fat.jar file and was unsuccessful as I was getting the error java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported class file major version 62 and google was telling me I need to completely uninstall java then redownload it at a lower version but this didn't seem like a good fix. I tried reaching out for help but because of the delay on the presentations due to connection issues could not get any.
